# Teaching-robotics
As Vice-President of the Coding and Robotics Society, one of my main functions is to give lectures on how to programme robotic systems to perform the actions we want them to perform.


# IN Bluetooth_with_LED_easy_explanatiion.ino
Explaining Bluetooth connections between an Android Smartphone and a robotic system built from scratch with an Arduino motherboard, a HC-06 slave Bluetooth module and a set of 4 LEDs placed forming a cross. The Android APP used is called "Bluetooth RC Car" and each of the 4 arrows (Forward, Backwards, Left or Right) will switch on the corresponding LED placed at the same position as the arrow when pressed.


# IN Bluetooth_with_LED.ino
A more complex way of connecting 4 LEDs by Bluetooth to an Smartphone than that presented on "Bluetooth_with_LED_easy_explanatiion.ino".
